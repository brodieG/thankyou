## R Acknowledgements

* R Core for developing and maintaining such a wonderful language.
* CRAN maintainers, for patiently shepherding packages onto CRAN and maintaining
  the repository, and Uwe Ligges in particular for maintaining
  [Winbuilder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/).
* [Jim Hester](https://github.com/jimhester) because
  [covr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covr) rocks.
* [Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel) and [Carl
  Boettiger](https://github.com/cboettig) for the
  [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) project, and [Gábor
  Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi) and the
  [R-consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) for
  [Rhub](https://github.com/r-hub), without which testing bugs on R-devel and
  other platforms would be a nightmare.
* [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui) for
  [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) and  [J.J.
  Allaire](https://github.com/jjallaire) etal for
  [rmarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown), and by extension
  John MacFarlane for [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).
* Stefan M. Bache for the idea of having a function for testing objects directly
  (originally `vetr` only worked with function arguments), which I took from
  ensurer.
* Hadley Wickham for [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools),
  and for pointing me to Stefan M. Bache's ensurer package.
* Olaf Mersmann for
  [microbenchmark](https://cran.r-project.org/package=microbenchmark), because
  microsecond matter.
